A Recent Call, and a Recent Seminar

As evidence of growing international interest in Human-Data Interaction, it was
pleasing to see [DARPA][] pick up on Human-Data Interaction in their recent
[Brandeis BAA][brandeis] (now closed) -- even to the extent of explicitly
referring to this website! With a reasonable size pot of money put on the table
($60M), here's hoping some really interesting and high-impact work gets funded.

I was also happy to give a [seminar][] recently to [CRASSH][], the Centre for
Research in the Arts, Social Sciences and Humanities. A good turnout (about 35
people), a really interesting mix (from linguists to medics to economists to
computer scientists, and they were only the ones who were admitting it!), and a
fascinating discussion. Plenty to think about afterwards about power
relationships, the social nature of data, and some practical areas where we
might start some implementation work. Slides I used are available [here](/resources/201504-crassh.pdf).
