We have crystalling the [HDI manifesto](http://ssrn.com/abstract=2508051) into a
concrete system that takes a user-centric approach to handling personal
data, described in our preprint paper *"[Personal Data: Thinking Inside the Box](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.04737v1.pdf)"* that is now available online.

The Databox paper was covered in the media by:

* MIT Tech Review in "[How A box could solve the personal data conundrum](http://www.technologyreview.com/view/534526/how-a-box-could-solve-the-personal-data-conundrum/)"
* The Guardian in "[Fightback against internet giants' stranglehold on personal data starts here
](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/01/control-personal-data-databox-end-user-agreement)"

As always, we'd welcome any feedback on any of these publications!
