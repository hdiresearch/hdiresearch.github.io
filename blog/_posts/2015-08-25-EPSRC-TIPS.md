After a Long Hiatus...

We haven't been completely idle in the preceding 10 months, honest!
Specifically, we've been attempting to set out in a bit more detail the HDI
concept and ideas discussed in the shorter previous papers at [DE'14][hdi-paper]
and our [CUCL Tech Report][hdi-tr]. We've now done so, and a copy of this
extended paper is online in [SSRN][].

We'd welcome any feedback!
